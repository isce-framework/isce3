class PathHash:
    """
    Implementation of a hash function for hierarchical namespaces with aliased entries.

    PathHash encodes the hierarchical relationships among its contents by having each node in
    the hierarchy store the names of the nodes that are its immediate children. Aliases are
    permitted and they hash to the same key as the original entry.

    PathHash does not provide storage for any values associated with the names of the various
    levels in the hierarchy; that's the responsibility of the client. One implementation
    strategy is to create a dictionary at the client side that maps the keys generated by
    PathHash to the associated values.
