    """
    Get common band filter for NISAR mixed-mode processing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    band_in : Band
        Input band.  Data is assumed basebanded to band_in.center
    band_out : Band
        Output band.  Must overlap input.
    fs : float
        Sample rate of input data in Hz.
    attenuation : float
        Minimum attenuation in filter stop band in dB.
    width : float
        Width of filter transitions as a fraction of common bandwidth.
    window : Tuple[str, float]
        Desired shape of passband.  Either None for flat or a tuple of
        (window_name, window_shape) such as ("kaiser", 1.6) or ("cosine", 0.7)

    Returns
    -------
    coeffs : ndarray
        Filter coeffients to apply to input data.  Length N will be odd, and
        group delay will be (N-1)/2.
    shift : float
        Phase ramp in rad/sample needed to apply to input data to make it
        baseband with respect to band_out.
