Welcome to ISCE's python documentation!
=======================================

ISCE's Python interface is built as two separate layers:

1. Cython interface for interacing with C++ code
2. Pyre interface for user-facing workflows

The Pyre interface uses the Cython interface to control the behavior of underlying C++ modules for coordinating behavior of different modules in workflows.
