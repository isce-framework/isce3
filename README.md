The InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE) is an open source library for
processing spaceborne and airborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar
(InSAR) data.

This project is a successor to the [ISCE2](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2)
framework. It is a ground-up redesign focusing on improved modularity,
documentation, and test-driven development.

Its initial development was funded by NASA's Earth Science Technology Office
(ESTO) under the Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) 2008 and is
currently being funded under the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) project.
